<h2>Description</h2>
<p>carbonara, a pasta dish, typically made with spaghetti, that blends <br>
     diced pork, eggs, cheese, and black pepper.</p>
<p>When U.S. military personnel arrived in Italy in 1943 to battle the forces of Fascist Italy <br>
      and Nazi Germany, they brought with them abundant stocks of powdered eggs<br>
      and dehydrated bacon, goods that served as a currency of goodwill—and <br>
     sometimes actual currency—in a starving nation. Combined with pasta, these ingredients became pasta carbonara,<br>
     the name suggesting food that one might feed a hungry coal miner in need of ample sustenance <br>
      before heading into the pit. Spaghetti alla carbonara—other forms of pasta will do, but spaghetti is the <br>
      common medium—is now a staple of Italian cuisine.</p>

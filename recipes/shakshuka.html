<h2>Description</h2>
<p>shakshuka, a Maghrebi (North African) dish, popular throughout the region.<br>
    featuring poached eggs in a spicy tomato sauce, seasoned with peppers, onion, garlic, and various spices. <br>
    The word shakshouka comes from Maghrebi Arabic dialect and means “mixed.”</p>

    <p>
        The dish developed after the arrival and spread of tomatoes and peppers in the region in the mid-16th century; <br>
         these New World foods were the result of the Columbian Exchange. <br>
          The dish, quickly and easily made, is a standard breakfast and lunch dish in Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt. <br>
           It is increasingly popular in Israel, where it was introduced by Jewish emigrants from the Maghreb in the 1950s and ’60s, with a subsequent wave in the 1990s. <br>
           The dish is also eaten in Spain, usually served with spicy chorizo sausage, and is a trendy addition to British pubs

    <li>Add the tomatoes. Cover and let simmer for about 15 minutes. Uncover and cook a bit longer to allow the mixture to reduce and thicken. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking.</li>
<li>Using a wooden spoon, make 6 indentations, or “wells,” in the tomato mixture (make sure the indentations are spaced out). Gently crack an egg into each indention</li>
<li>Reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook on low until the egg whites are set.</li>
<li>Uncover and add black pepper or crushed red pepper, if you like. Serve with warm pita, challah, or crusty bread of your choice.</li>

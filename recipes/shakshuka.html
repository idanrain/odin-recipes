<ol>
    <li>
        Heat 3 tbsp olive oil in a large cast iron skillet. Add the onion, garlic, paprika, pinch salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Add the tomatoes. Cover and let simmer for about 15 minutes. Uncover and cook a bit longer to allow the mixture to reduce and thicken. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking.</li>
<li>Using a wooden spoon, make 6 indentations, or “wells,” in the tomato mixture (make sure the indentations are spaced out). Gently crack an egg into each indention</li>
<li>Reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook on low until the egg whites are set.</li>
<li>Uncover and add black pepper or crushed red pepper, if you like. Serve with warm pita, challah, or crusty bread of your choice.</li>

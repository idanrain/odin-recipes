    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tarte Tatin is a pastry in which the fruit (usually apples) <br>
         is caramelized in butter and sugar before the tart is baked. <br>
         Named after the Tatin sisters who invented it and served it in their hotel as its signature dish, it originated in France <br>
         but has spread to other countries over time.</p>
        <p>

         A popular myth tells that the dessert was accidentally created at the Hôtel Tatin in 
         central France in the 1880s. 
        </p>
         The hotel was run by two sisters, Stéphanie and Caroline Tatin. <br>
         There are a few myths about the tart's origin, the most common is that Stéphanie Tatin, who did most of the cooking, was tired one day and <br>
         tried to make a traditional apple pie, but she left the apples cooking in butter and sugar for too long. <br>
           Smelling the burning, she tried to save the dish by putting the pastry base on top of the pan of apples <br>
            and quickly finishing the cooking by putting the whole pan in the oven. <br>
            </p>
           <p>
            After serving the upside-down tart, she was surprised to find how much the hotel guests liked the dessert. <br>
             In a different version of the myth, Stéphanie baked a caramelized apple tart upside-down by mistake <br>

             <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Flaky Pastry</h3> 
             <ul>
                

<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li> 
<li>1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
<li> 110g unsalted butter, cold, cut into cubes</li>
<li>3 tablespoons ice water</li>
</ul>

<h3>Apple Filling
</h3>

<ul>
<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
<li> 140g unsalted butter, cut into thin slices</li>
<li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 kg apples peeled and halved </li>
<li>Crème fraîche, whipped cream, or ice cream, for serving</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>Make the Flaky Pastry</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Blend the flour with the salt in a food processor. </li>
         <li>Add the butter and process until well blended, about 8 seconds.</li>
          <li>Add the water and process just until the water has been absorbed and the mixture looks like wet sand.</li>
          <li> Transfer the pastry to a work surface and knead lightly until it comes together. </li>
            <li>Pat the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.</li>

<li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the pastry into an 11 1/2-inch round. Drape the dough over a rolling pin, then open it out on a baking sheet lined with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Meanwhile, make the apple filling</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Spread the sugar evenly in the bottom of a 9-inch cast-iron skillet. Scatter the butter over the sugar and drizzle with the vanilla.</li>
    <li> Arrange the apple halves on their sides in the skillet in 2 concentric circles with all of the apples facing the same direction. <br>
        Pack the apples closely together. Place 1 apple half in the center to fill the empty space.</li>
    <li>Set the skillet over moderately low heat and cook the apples until the surrounding syrup becomes a thick, golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. <br>
    Baste the apples with the syrup regularly with a bulb baster. The liquid should remain at a gentle bubble.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F. </li>
    <li>Place the skillet on a baking sheet and bake the apples for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven. </li>
    <li>Drape the Flaky Pastry over the apples and carefully push the edge of the pastry down inside the pan.</li>
    <li>Return the skillet to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and the juices are bubbling over.</li>
<li>Remove the tart from the oven. Immediately invert a platter with a lip over the skillet. <br>
     Quickly and carefully invert the tart onto the platter so the apples are on top.<br>
     If any apples stick to the skillet, set them back into the tart.</li> 
<li>Serve warm or at room temperature, with dollops of crème fraîche, whipped cream, or ice cream.</li>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tarte Tatin is a pastry in which the fruit (usually apples) <br>
         is caramelized in butter and sugar before the tart is baked. <br>
         Named after the Tatin sisters who invented it and served it in their hotel as its signature dish, it originated in France <br>
         but has spread to other countries over time.</p>
        <p>

         A popular myth tells that the dessert was accidentally created at the Hôtel Tatin in 
         central France in the 1880s. 
        </p>
         The hotel was run by two sisters, Stéphanie and Caroline Tatin. <br>
         There are a few myths about the tart's origin, the most common is that Stéphanie Tatin, who did most of the cooking, was tired one day and <br>
         tried to make a traditional apple pie, but she left the apples cooking in butter and sugar for too long. <br>
           Smelling the burning, she tried to save the dish by putting the pastry base on top of the pan of apples <br>
            and quickly finishing the cooking by putting the whole pan in the oven. <br>
            </p>
           <p>
            After serving the upside-down tart, she was surprised to find how much the hotel guests liked the dessert. <br>
             In a different version of the myth, Stéphanie baked a caramelized apple tart upside-down by mistake <br>
